### naive bayes
    p(category given observation) = p(category) * p(observation given category) / p(observation)  
    p(observation given category) = let p = 1 for feature in observation : p *= p(feature given category)
    p(observation) = let p = 1 feature in observation: p *= p(feature)
    
    p(feature) = nb(observation with feature) / nb (all observation)
    p(category) = nb(observation labeled category) / nb (all observation)
    p(featue given category) = nb(observation with feature, labeled category) / nb (observation labeled category)
    
    
### a negation of feature  (!feature)
    p(!feature) = 1 - p(feature)
    if (feature in not observation) => feature in not observation   
    
##Â backlog 
 1) reporting a labeled observation to a naive bayes model instance
 2) invoking a model instance to get the probabilities of each category for an input observation 
 3) capability to scale (supporting load)  
 4) getting a metadata for model instance
 5) reporting a unlabeled observation to a naive bayes model instance then set label later
